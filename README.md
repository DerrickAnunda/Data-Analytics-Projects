**CUSTOMER CHUN ANALYSIS FOR A TELECOM COMPANY**

Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or to cancel a subscription to a service. It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once you can identify those customers that are at risk of cancelling, you should know exactly what marketing action to take for each individual customer to maximise the chances that the customer will remain.

**OBJECTIVE:** To identify key drivers of customer churn and develop data-driven recommendations for improving customer retention. 

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Customer Demographics & Segmentation
- Contract Type Analysis
- Service Usage Patterns
- Payment Methods
- Customer Service Interactions

**Tools**
- Excel
- Power BI
  
**Overall Churn Situation**

The company is experiencing a significant churn rate of 26.86%, with 1,796 customers churned out of 6,687 total customers. This is a concerning level that requires immediate attention

**Primary Churn Drivers**

- Competitor-related issues are the dominant reason for churn, with multiple competitor factors appearing at the top of the reasons list
- Price sensitivity is evident, with "Price too high" being a notable churn reason
- Service quality issues (attitude, network reliability, service dissatisfaction) form another significant cluster of churn reasons

**Demographic and Customer Segments**

_**Age-based patterns:**_
- Older customers (60+ years) show significantly higher churn rates
- The trend line shows a clear correlation between age and churn probability

_**Group size impact:**__
- Single customers have the highest churn rate (~30%)
- Churn rates dramatically decrease for groups of 2 or more customers
- This suggests a "strength in numbers" effect where group plans are more sticky

**Contract and Service Patterns**

_**Contract type influence:**_
- Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn (76.86%)
- Longer-term contracts (One Year, Two Year) have significantly lower churn rates

_**Customer lifecycle:**_
- Early months show highest churn risk (around 60% in first few months)
- Churn risk steadily decreases with account length
- After 40 months, churn risk stabilizes at a lower level

_**Data plan impacts:**_
- Unlimited data plan users with high consumption (5-10 GB) show higher churn
- International plan usage shows interesting patterns with varying churn rates

_**Payment methods:**_
- Direct Debit represents 55.36% of customers
- Credit Card users make up 39.09%
- Paper Check users are the smallest segment at 5.55%

**RECOMENDATIONS**
"Our analysis reveals a critical customer retention challenge, with over a quarter of our customer base churning. The data points to three main areas of vulnerability:
- Contract Structure: The high proportion of month-to-month contracts is creating instability in our customer base.
- Early Lifecycle Risk: The first 40 months are crucial, with particularly high risk in the first few months.
- Competitive Pressure: Competitor offerings are successfully attracting our customers, particularly those who are price-sensitive.

_**opportunities for improvement**_
- Promoting group plans could significantly reduce churn risk
- Converting customers to longer-term contracts could provide more stability
- Enhanced early-lifecycle engagement could help navigate the high-risk initial period
